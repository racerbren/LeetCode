My solution to 1431 has run time O(n) where the size parameter n is constrained to the size of the provided std::vector parameter. When compared with other solutions on LeetCode, my solution beats 100% of others while keeping memory usage low. Howver, some improvements can be made in order to use less memory. One adjustment could be to use and return the original std::vector candies instead of declaring a new one. This could be done by replacing the number of candies with a 0 for false and a 1 for true.
