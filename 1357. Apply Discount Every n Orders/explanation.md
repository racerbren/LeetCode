This solution to problem 1357 runs in linear time, O(n), where the size parameter n is constrained to the length of the input vector products since the for loop iterates over that vector. 
The memory complexity of this solution is quite large, however. The memory depends on the size of an object instance of the Cashier class which has member variables, int, int, float, and map<int, int>. Floats and integers are 4 bytes each. The size of the map depends on the number of integers, but is a multiple of 8 bytes since this map is constructed using a dictionary of integers which are 4 bytes each.
